# Core Functionality
This platform integrates two key predictive models to deliver comprehensive insights:

## Custom LSTM Architecture: 
Built specifically for time-series forecasting, the LSTM model predicts stock trends based on enriched historical data, including technical indicators like moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and Relative Strength Index (RSI).

## Fine-Tuned BERT Sentiment Analysis: 
Analyzes financial news headlines and social media sentiment, then classifies market sentiment as bullish, bearish, or neutral. This sentiment score is combined with LSTM predictions.

# Key Features
### Comprehensive Stock Analysis: 
Predicts stock trends, evaluates risks, and provides investment recommendations (e.g., Strong Buy, Hold, Moderate Sell).
### Portfolio Insights: 
Aggregates risk (VaR), sentiment scores, and portfolio composition metrics to give users a holistic view of their investments.
